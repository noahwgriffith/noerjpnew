      <description>Feature Set When learning a language radically different from your native tongue you quickly discover new features. I know a lot of learners hate kanji, but it&amp;rsquo;s by far my favorite part of Japanese. These little characters all have their own unique personality. They can convey a lot of meaning by themselves and the reading is not necessarily consistent. This gives the written language a degree of flexibility not granted to you in English.</description>

      <description>Dedicated to Jack This post is dedicated to my friend Jack. I may never be able to convince you of immersion learning, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It&amp;rsquo;s good blog fuel. This post is basically a letter to him. Taking his main problems with the method as a jumping off point, I am setting out to convince him. My goal is to get him to incorporate immersion.
 Why learn a language?</description>
