      <description>Despite being really bad at it I always feel the need to explain myself. I think at some point immersion learning becomes obvious. Obviously you&amp;rsquo;ll never become competent in a language you aren&amp;rsquo;t exposed to. You&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to understand native speech if you never listen to native speech. These days more people seem to understand why daily exposure is a prerequisite to really being good at a language. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean being able to write a correct sentence after thinking about it for five minutes.</description>

      <description>Dedicated to Jack This post is dedicated to my friend Jack. I may never be able to convince you of immersion learning, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It&amp;rsquo;s good blog fuel. This post is basically a letter to him. Taking his main problems with the method as a jumping off point, I am setting out to convince him. My goal is to get him to incorporate immersion.
 Why learn a language?</description>
