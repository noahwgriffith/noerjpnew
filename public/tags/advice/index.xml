      <description>Preface I am not a qualified linguist nor do I pretend to be. That said, I think I have a pretty compelling explanation, based on experience, as to why the most frequent and basic words in your second language are often the most difficult to wrap your head around.
The Color Spectrum Reality is a lot like color. I&amp;rsquo;m going to sidestep the whole prescriptive vs. descriptive controversy for a moment, but keep in mind what I&amp;rsquo;m about to say is very close to touching that third rail.</description>

      <description>Small Break This past month I have been less active in online immersion learning circles. I&amp;rsquo;ve been absent from Refold, an acquaintances server, and this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple major life events happen and as a result didn&amp;rsquo;t have much choice in having to put Japanese to the side. Nothing major happened though and I&amp;rsquo;m fine.
