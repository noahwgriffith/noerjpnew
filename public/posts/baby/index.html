<p>This post is dedicated to my friend Jack. I may never be able to convince you of immersion learning, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s good blog fuel. This post
is basically a letter to him. Taking his main problems with the method as a jumping off point, I am setting out to convince him. My goal is to get him to incorporate immersion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why learn a language?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously. Why? We speak a da English. You aren&rsquo;t <em>really</em> missing out on anything if you&rsquo;re an English monolingual, despite what people will tell you.
English is effectively the <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%83%95%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AB#%E8%8B%B1%E8%AA%9E">lingua franca of the world</a>.</p>
<p>This question is the most important in your language learning. If you don&rsquo;t want to be fluent, and I mean truly fluent (have you seen how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0-IrQY4ix8">Europeans
speak English?</a>), then this method is overkill. If you want to learn a little to say hi to people in the country when you visit, then this method is a waste of time. It takes a long time to get good.</p>
<h2 id="no-immerse-no-good">No Immerse, No Good</h2>
<p>The thing is, though, if you want to get really good at your language&hellip; If you want to be able to function like an adult and build real relationships with native speakers&hellip; I think you <em>have</em> to immerse. Speaking with natives
is good once you can speak. But you won&rsquo;t magically become able to speak just by talking to people. It sounds counterintuitive but language is a
counterintuitive skill. How will you know the words if you never hear them? How will you know the accent if you never hear it? How will you know whether or
not &ldquo;you are speak understand well, but natural sound it not have?&rdquo; How will you know? Will native speakers <em>really</em> correct you?</p>
<h2 id="youre-just-a-baby">You&rsquo;re Just a Baby</h2>
<p>In your target language you&rsquo;re just a baby. A dumb, drooling, goo goo ga ga baby. You don&rsquo;t understand anything, you can barely babble yourself, and
when adults speak to you, they too speak like babies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seriously. We all know how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm37vKnDdh8">adults talk to babies</a>. If someone started speaking like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKjaFG4YN6g">this</a> to you in English, you&rsquo;d be talking to them like a baby. Anyone who has ever
dealt with outsourced customer service knows what I&rsquo;m talking about. It&rsquo;s annoying when someone speaks your language badly.
Nobody is asking for perfection, but being intelligible and speaking accurately are two very important things.</p>
<h2 id="wont-i-learn-this-from-natives">Won&rsquo;t I Learn This from Natives?</h2>
<p>No. And here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>When someone speaks English that badly, you talk to them like a baby. When you talk to them like a baby, your English is
<em>necessarily limited</em>. You don&rsquo;t speak quickly and naturally, and your vocabulary is limited. I firmly believe this is why speaking early
works so well at first, but you quickly stop progressing once you hit the level of a baby.</p>
<h2 id="ok-then-where-will-i-learn">OK. Then Where <em>Will</em> I Learn?</h2>
<p>By far the most common question I get from Jack is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where will I learn X? How do I learn X? Do you have tips for getting used to X?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is <strong>immersion</strong>. And this is the key thing. You are going to steal the language from natives. The textbook is wrong. Your
friends will likely tell you something they find <em>funny</em> to hear a <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%BA">外人</a> say (if they have any sense of humor at all). Your teacher is wrong. It&rsquo;s all wrong. The only correct language is the language spoken by natives. And
nobody will give that to you. You have to take it from natives. And in all likelihood your conversation partner is speaking to you
in baby-language. This is one of the main reasons why immersion is <em>so important</em>.</p>
<p>It took me a year and a half to get to the point where my friend Ayu-chan speaks to me like an adult. And that&rsquo;s only because I speak to
<em>her</em> like an adult. An intelligent, educated adult. I still make mistakes. But I very rarely make the kind of mistakes that make me
sound like an idiot. They just make me sound foreign. And I&rsquo;m <em>still</em> improving. Every day while immersing I find myself saying &ldquo;Oh!
<em>That&rsquo;s</em> how a native would say it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="a-few-examples">A Few Examples</h2>
<p>Because this might not be concrete enough, I wanted to offer a few examples to real questions from Jack.</p>
<h3 id="word-order">Word Order</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You might want to explain what they are supposed to do to get used to the different writing style (word order)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japanese is too complex to consciously convert from English word order to it&rsquo;s native word order.</p>
<p><img src="/IMG_2772.jpg" alt="Word Order"></p>
<p>There are too many moving
parts. Not to mention there is no such thing as a one to one English-Japanese translation. The Japanese language has functions
that literally don&rsquo;t exist in English. This can be seen in the image above. Imagine you know the word for cat 猫, and you understand
that いる means something like &ldquo;is.&rdquo; When you see the sentence</p>
<blockquote>
<p>猫がいる</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along with a kid pointing at a cat. You can intuitively figure out what this means. This process slowly builds in complexity the more
language you intuitively understand. Maybe the next layer is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>あそこに猫がいる</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually you will start understanding rather long and complex sentences. Here&rsquo;s an example from my Anki deck</p>
<blockquote>
<p>魂と引き換えに悪魔が願いを 叶えてくれるってところは、そりゃ猿の手に似ているのかもしれないけれど</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you build this intuitive understanding, the language becomes easier. You become able to understand more complex sentences over time.
All without ever having to worry too much about the word order. Of course at some level you will be aware that the order is different,
but I have no idea how to explain it to someone. I don&rsquo;t know the one-to-one changes because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t actually matter</li>
<li>I learned it intuitively</li>
</ol>
<p>One more important thing is that the distinction between SOV and SVO is meaningless.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to say that there is no real meaning in terms of linguistics. But you&rsquo;re a language learner, not a linguist. It&rsquo;s like trying to throw a football by calculating parabolas. Not to mention the fact that two languages that are both SOV will still have different
clause orders. So it&rsquo;s best to stop worrying about it and just try to understand the damn language as it is.</p>
<h3 id="ambiguity">Ambiguity</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I can only understand, like, 40%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good. That means your subconscious is going to work figuring out the other 60%. The same way I discussed before, you will slowly figure out 41%. Then 42%. One word at a time. One slight change in nuance at a time. One sentence at a time. Don&rsquo;t be a murderous bastard and
dissect the language. Applying causative form here with this formula that changes the word order to be this with this nuance blah
blah blah. <em>It doesn&rsquo;t work</em>. I can&rsquo;t speak any language I learned in school because at best the classroom is a primer for real
immersion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deep breath</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I forgot what the point of this paragraph was.</p>
<p>You need to tolerate ambiguity. Once you accept that you <em>have to immerse</em> in some form, the challenge is accepting ambiguity.</p>
<p>Like I said before, you&rsquo;re just a baby. So the adults in the room might speak to you like a baby. You might only understand a fraction of what&rsquo;s going on like a baby. But you have agency. You can use a dictionary. You can immerse with a monolingual dictionary and get better even faster. You can do it. It&rsquo;s hard at first to get used to not following. But it becomes a game eventually. You start enjoying
trying to figure out what the characters are saying. Every sentence you understand is a victory. Sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way
because you say &ldquo;well I already understand it.&rdquo; The truth is, you might not have been able to understand the sentence last week. In that
time you picked up some small nuance of the usage of a tiny little word, and <em>you never realized you did</em>, but that&rsquo;s why you can
understand this sentence today.</p>
<p>You cannot tell when language acquisition is happening. It never feels like you&rsquo;re progressing. Until you rewatch a show from 6 months
ago and realize &ldquo;Wait what the fart? How was this hard back then? What was the deal??&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every scene is a victory.
Every paragraph is a victory.
Every sentence is a victory.
Every SRS rep is a victory.
Every word is a victory.
Every sound you can hear is a victory.
Every kanji element you look at is a victory.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re just a baby. I was just a baby 20 years ago. Now I like to think my English is pretty native-level, although not &ldquo;perfect.&rdquo; Babies still get better. Every. Single. Day. In <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E5%BE%AE%E5%A6%99">微妙</a> ways.</p>
<p>Too many links?</p>
