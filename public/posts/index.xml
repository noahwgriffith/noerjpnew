      <title>Why I love Kanji (And You Should Too)</title>

      <description>Feature Set When learning a language radically different from your native tongue you quickly discover new features. I know a lot of learners hate kanji, but it&amp;rsquo;s by far my favorite part of Japanese. These little characters all have their own unique personality. They can convey a lot of meaning by themselves and the reading is not necessarily consistent. This gives the written language a degree of flexibility not granted to you in English.</description>

      <title>Listening &amp; Connected Speech</title>

      <description>Despite being really bad at it I always feel the need to explain myself. I think at some point immersion learning becomes obvious. Obviously you&amp;rsquo;ll never become competent in a language you aren&amp;rsquo;t exposed to. You&amp;rsquo;ll never be able to understand native speech if you never listen to native speech. These days more people seem to understand why daily exposure is a prerequisite to really being good at a language. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean being able to write a correct sentence after thinking about it for five minutes.</description>

      <description>So you have your immersion environment. You&amp;rsquo;re ready to plug in and listen to gibberish all day. Great! But how do you actually learn anything?
 Why is this website so vague? It seems to be all theoretical advice! Why won&amp;rsquo;t you give me anything concrete? And why are you so goddamn handsome?
 Patients, my friends. All will be answered in due time.
School Method I remember my first day of Italian class like it was yesterday.</description>

      <description>Preface I am not a qualified linguist nor do I pretend to be. That said, I think I have a pretty compelling explanation, based on experience, as to why the most frequent and basic words in your second language are often the most difficult to wrap your head around.
The Color Spectrum Reality is a lot like color. I&amp;rsquo;m going to sidestep the whole prescriptive vs. descriptive controversy for a moment, but keep in mind what I&amp;rsquo;m about to say is very close to touching that third rail.</description>

      <title>I Took a Chinese Class</title>

      <description>So I took a Chinese class Last semester I took a Chinese class and thought it would be enlightening to share my experience. It turns out classes are extremely helpful and I learned a ton.
Just Kidding
Classes suck. The teacher could barely speak English despite being in America for over a decade. How am I supposed to take her advice seriously?
I only know how to say one sentence in Chinese.</description>

      <title>What Should I Watch? Noer&#39;s Official Top Recommendations</title>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t as common of a question but I have been asked from time to time. Someone will be onboard with the method and say something like
 Great! I understand how this works now&amp;hellip; but everything is too hard and I have no idea what to watch.
 Which has always been bizarre to me. Just follow your interests. Perhaps a better explanation is needed.
Why You Should Follow Your Interests Listen man, you&amp;rsquo;re gonna have to spend an overwhelming of time in your language to &amp;ldquo;git gud&amp;rdquo; as it were.</description>

      <title>Why You Should(n&#39;t) Take a Break</title>

      <description>Small Break This past month I have been less active in online immersion learning circles. I&amp;rsquo;ve been absent from Refold, an acquaintances server, and this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a couple major life events happen and as a result didn&amp;rsquo;t have much choice in having to put Japanese to the side. Nothing major happened though and I&amp;rsquo;m fine. I always feared having to take a break but having gone through it I think I&amp;rsquo;ve come away with a new perspective.</description>

      <description>久しぶりに日記を書いたなって思って、今日もまた書きたいって思います。それでは、今日のテーマをするのは最近読み終わった小説「化物語。」早速行きましょう！
化物語っていうのラノベは二つの巻があって、僕は読書速度は結構遅くて、学校の生活が忙しくて、二か月かかったくらいで読み終わりました。なんだかちょっと恥ずかしいけどやっぱり日本語は母語じゃないし、まあいいかなって思ってきました（笑）。化物語はラノベ（ライトノベルっていうの和製英語の略）であって、皆詳しいわけではないのでちょっと解説したいと思います。ライトノベルは小説と漫画との中間である。つまりラノベは小説みたいに長くて、画像はないし、文語で書いてあるが、ネタは漫画みたいな本です。
西尾維新が書いた「化物語」っていう小説は僕が初めて読み終えたラノベですよ。話は解説しにくいけどともかくちょっとだけ解説していきたいと思います。主人公の阿良々木暦は吸血鬼である。周りの女子高生には心理的な問題が怪異に現れている。それで阿良々木の恩人の忍野メメの世話で女子高生の病気を直したり、色んな冒険してます。特に僕にとって難しい点は日本語の言葉遊びです。たとえば、二つの女子高生神原駿河と戦場ヶ原は「ヴァルハラコンビ」って学校によく知っている。それは神原の「原」漢字と戦場ヶ原の「原」の漢字を混ぜて、原原（ばるはら）と読めるからです。そして想像しにくい画像がいっぱいあります。たとえば忍野忍、金髪である少女は、阿良々木の影に潜んで住んでいます。何となく想像できるようになってきたけど最初から大変でした。
それでは以上だと思います。また読んでくれて本当に嬉しいです。さっきの日記に訂正を入れてくれて本当にありがたいです。また訂正して欲しいので、これからもよろしくお願いします！</description>

      <description>This is the start of a series of diary entries in Japanese. The point is to demonstrate why (I think) you can trust my advice, and to be completely transparent about my skill level. Mistakes included. I am aware of mistakes in this writing, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good sample of where my ability was a couple months ago.
 みなさまこんにちはノアです！今日から積極的にアウトプットの練習を始めようかなと思います。とういうわけで、さっきの二年間ぐらいでほとんど聞く、読むだけで日本語を練習していたので話すのはまだ緊張しすぎてとにかく書いたほうがいいんじゃないかな。何を話せばいいか分からないけど、最近日本の音楽とかについて考えています。正直に言うと音楽を聞くのと言語を勉強するのはあんまり成功の高い方法ではないと思います。それでもやっぱり日本の音楽が大好き。最初に勉強を始めた時から特に気に入ったバンドはtoeである。普通に歌詞などは付けてなく流石マスロックだよね。toeは日本一の最高のマスロックバンドだと思います。ギターとドラムの音色がヤバすぎる。みんなにすごくお勧めのバンドですよ。聞いて下さい！それでは一冊目に書いた日記を読んでくれて本当にありがとうごさいます！</description>

      <description>Dedicated to Jack This post is dedicated to my friend Jack. I may never be able to convince you of immersion learning, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. It&amp;rsquo;s good blog fuel. This post is basically a letter to him. Taking his main problems with the method as a jumping off point, I am setting out to convince him. My goal is to get him to incorporate immersion.

      <title>What Is Immersion?</title>

      <description>Confusion There often seems to be confusion about what is meant by immersion. Most people assume it has something to do with living in the country in which your target language is spoken. They assume they need to plan a trip to this country and, after having learned the basics at home, they will magically develop fluency just by being on that country&amp;rsquo;s soil.
Well the good news is that none of that is quite accurate.</description>

      <description>You want to learn Japanese (or another language). This website is about how to do that effectively.
This website is not a detailed explanation about why that works. (Though there will be some explanation.) For more detail about the point of this website see about.
Who is this for? Friends have asked me how to learn a language. Hi Kyle. Hi Jack. I wanted to put a concise explanation online so people can read it.</description>
