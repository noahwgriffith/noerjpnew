This isn't as common of a question but I have been asked from time to time. Someone will be onboard with the method and say something like

> Great! I understand how this works now... but everything is too hard and I have no idea what to watch.

Which has always been bizarre to me. Just [follow your interests.](/posts/start-here#how-does-this-work) Perhaps a better explanation is needed.

## Why You Should Follow Your Interests

Listen man, you're gonna have to spend an overwhelming of time in your language to "git gud" as it were. So ideally you would stop listening to me and start watching your favorite shows. I won't judge you if that means reading doujin or whatever. Anything that gets you plugged in and burning the hours works. I can't dictate your interests so you need to start with the fun stuff. This is, like, AJATT 101 advice.

It's your life and your decision to put the required time into this. It won't happen overnight. It won't happen in under a year. So you need to find a way to enjoy yourself. If you're stressed about what to watch you're already doing it wrong. Pick something cool. You need to go grug brain and say

> Haha. Cute girls and robots with explosions. Who cares what's happening?

The language will come. Right now you cannot stress about how much you understand. Which leads me to...

## Why Difficulty Doesn't Matter

Sure. As you progress a little it might make sense to gauge the difficulty of content. You'll start getting more out of slice of life shows once you understand the absolute core vocabulary. But even then, the difficulty doesn't matter. And especially at first it does not matter. You're still looking up words. And your subconscious is still going to work processing the phonetics, grammar, vocabulary, and other intangibles of culture and language.

## Dramas

### Ikebukuro West Gate Park

![iwgp](/iwgp.jpg)

For the other shows on this list I won't provide a description. But this show is too good not to. This is the OG AJATT drama. Required viewing, quite frankly. Apparently there's an anime of the same name. Haven't seen it and refuse to. The original 2000 drama is pure gold.

Here's the plot summary from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikebukuro_West_Gate_Park_(TV_series))

> Twenty-one-year-old Makoto, the former #1 waru of Ikebukuro in his high school years, hangs out at the bowling alley and in the eponymous park (池袋西口公園 (Ikebukuro Nishiguchi-koen)) of the series with best friend Masa on a repetitive nightly basis. Their world starts to change as Shun, Rika, and Hikaru enter their lives after chance meetings in the park. Soon after, Rika is found raped and murdered in a love hotel, bringing unwanted police attention and a new detective to Ikebukuro on the trail of a serial rapist. After being suspected, arrested, and detained by the police in classic Japanese style (beatings, coerced confessions), Makoto is released and vows to find justice for Rika. Enlisting the help of Takashi, an old school friend, and his gang, the G-Boys, Makoto starts his search and gains a reputation for getting problems solved in the underworld of Ikebukuro - much to the consternation of Yokoyama and the police. Things then begin to spiral out of control in Ikebukuro, as not everything is what it seems to be... 

Everyone in this show mumbles so bad. It'll seriously push your listening to the next level. It stars Tomoya Nagase, who on his own is worth imitating. His Japanese is just so cool. It's pretty rough, though, so try not to get punched/made fun of for talking like him.

There's so much more to say about this show. Like how it showcases the 90/early 2000s 池袋 culture. The color gangs. The over-the-top aesthetic. But for the sake of "brevity" (of which I am clearly incapable) I'll leave it at that.

### I"s

![I"s](/is.jpg)

No clue what's going on in the title with the quotation marks. Easy drama for beginners.

## Anime

### ReLIFE

![relife](/relife.jpg)

Very natural language as far as I can tell.

### FLCL

![flcl](/flcl.jpg)

I have no idea what happened when I watched [this show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79Eks9bOY4U). I really don't think it's a language issue. No, seriously, what the hell did I just watch? And why is the music so banger?

### K-On

![k-on](/kon.jpg)

## Manga

### Yotsuba&!

![yotsuba](/yotsuba.jpg)

Great for beginners.

## Light Novels

### Monogatari Series

![monogatari](/monogatari.jpg)

The wordplay can be really cool but confusing for beginners. Still, it's not actually THAT hard.
