Despite being really bad at it I always feel the need to explain myself. I think at some point immersion learning becomes obvious. Obviously you'll never become competent in a language you aren't exposed to. You'll never be able to understand native speech if you *never listen to native speech.* These days more people seem to understand why daily exposure is a prerequisite to really being good at a language. I don't mean being able to write a correct sentence after thinking about it for five minutes. I mean really being able to speak off the cuff, text casually, appreciate humor, and understand natives. Trying to understand natives without listening to natives is like trying to skateboard without getting on the board and falling a few times. Learning a language with textbooks is like trying to learn how to swim by reading about [fluid mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics).

## Why Listening Works

Like I said, I always somehow feel like I need to explain myself. On the one hand the whole process of immersion is like magic. *It just werks.* On the other hand it's so predictable. There's one very specific feature of language I want to demonstrate here to hopefully explain why listening works so well. You can, and will, pick this up without ever consciously understanding it from a linguistics perspective (just like the rest of the language). I still want to explain it because it might help put the whole thing into perspective.

That feature is *connected speech*. When natives speak they sort of slur their words together, the stumble over them, they mumble, and they blur the sounds together. When we speak English we don't say "Hey, what's up?" We say "Hey, wassup?"

## Catenation

Specifically this is what linguists call *catenation*. It's when the end of the previous word combines with the beginning of the next word phonetically.

*Is he busy?* -> *Is'i busy?*

*I want that orange* -> *I want thadorange*

## Intrusion

Intrusion is when an additional sound is inserted between two words.

*He asked* -> *Heyasked*

*Do it* -> *Dewit*

*She answered* -> *Sheyanswered*

## Elision

Elision can be even harder to understand. This is when sounds are dropped from words entirely.

*Next door* -> *Nexdoor*

*Most common* -> *Moscommon*

## Assimilation

This is when two sounds are blurred together and form a new sound entirely.

*Don't you* -> *Donchew*

*Did you* -> *Dijew*

## Listen, Listen, and then Listen

So are you going to memorize all of this? Hell no. That's insane. In fact, with these English examples, it's incredibly likely you never consciously realized this was happening. As I frequently say, your brain is designed to pick up on language subconsciously in this way. If you listen a lot, you'll start to imitate the correct way of saying these combinations. You likely won't have to put that much deliberate effort into it.

Just don't be surprised when...
