## So I took a Chinese class

Last semester I took a Chinese class and thought it would be enlightening to share my experience. It turns out classes are extremely helpful and I learned a ton.

Just Kidding

Classes suck. The teacher could barely speak English despite being in America for over a decade. How am I supposed to take her advice seriously?

I only know how to say one sentence in Chinese. *And it contains words I never learned in class*.

> 我爱你

I only know how to say this because it's a Chinese sentence in a *Japanese song*. (Japanese proficiency makes this unbelievably easy. It's basically all cognates.)



Call it accidental immersion.
