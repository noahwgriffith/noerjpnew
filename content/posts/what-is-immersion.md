## Confusion

There often seems to be confusion about what is *meant* by immersion. Most people assume it has something to do with living in the
country in which your target language is spoken. They assume they need to plan a trip to this country and, after having learned the
basics at home, they will magically develop fluency just by being on that country's soil.

Well the good news is that none of that is quite accurate. You can do this immersion thing at home, and largely for free. All that
is needed is a little bit of will power, tweaking your environment, and a *lot* of content.

## What does it mean, actually?

Immersion is simply being surrounded by your target language. That's it. If you're listening to a podcast in your target language,
you're immersing. If you're watching TV. You're immersing. The more you do this, the better you get at your language. It really is
that simple.

## Immersion environment - What to do

Right now in my room I have a bookshelf of about 30 Japanese books. On my computer is around 10 more. I have around 1TB of anime.
100GB of j-dramas. 40GB of movies. I have a kana poster I printed out when I started learning over 2 years ago. In my car is the
伯物語 drama CD. I listen to Japanese podcasts and music when I commute to school, and I do my best to fill my free time with
Japanese things. This tends to be reading light novels, and watching j-dramas and anime. As I write this I'm listening to that
[伯物語 drama CD](https://youtu.be/AH3jF5aIbPM) I mentioned before.

This is not an effort to flex how much of a loser I am, just to illustrate what this immersion thing looks like. (lol!)

You do not have to copy me exactly, but this should give you an idea of what to do. The idea is to have Japanese things audio and
text enter your eyes and ears. And do it a lot. The original AJATT blog author, 勝元殿 hit 18-24 hours daily. You do not have
to go this far. A few hours a day is enough, just keep in mind it might take you longer to reach your goal. I try to aim for 6-8
hours. Keep in mind that a lot of this time is just listening unattentively with something on in the background. This is time
you can make during a commute, doing homework, or down time during work (if you can get away with it).

## Have fun

Most importantly, you should pick stuff you like. You want to avoid boredom and burnout. Jump straight into the stuff you want
to understand. You can always go back to it. If you watch something geared toward beginners because you think it'll somehow be
"good for you" but hate every second of it, that would be a waste.

## Look-ups

The thing is, especially as a beginner, you don't understand anything. Of course you're still getting used to the language, but
it can be really easy to just spin your wheels forever. You want to be *looking things up in a dictionary* as you listen/watch/read. You
want to do this intelligently, though. It doesn't make much sense to be looking up rare, specific things before you get a foothold
in the language. So don't look up 肝硬変 (cirrhosis of the liver). Do look up the target language equivalents of "see" "hear"
"this" "that" "your mom."

## Let the environment do the work

Part of the reason the environment is so important is that you effectively don't have to make time for "study." If your default
mode is interacting with your target language, then by default you're always getting better. Some people go really hardcore on this
and forego important things like hanging out with friends. **I am not advocating for this.** I *am* advocating that you make the
time for this every single day. And you throw on a little Japanese every chance you get.

## Good Immersion

If nothing else, I suggest you take this away.

Good immersion looks like:

1. Interesting content
2. Looking things up in a dictionary
3. **Not** translating entire sentences
4. Stress-free, fun content.
5. Letting the difficult things go.
6. Accepting that you won't understand everything.

So go on, turn on the TV. [Lawfully obtain a library of shows.](https://nyaa.si/) Plug in.
