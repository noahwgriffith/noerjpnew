## Preface

I am not a qualified linguist nor do I pretend to be. That said, I think I have a pretty compelling explanation, based on experience, as to why the most frequent and basic words in your second language are often the most difficult to wrap your head around.

## The Color Spectrum

Reality is a lot like color. I'm going to sidestep the whole [prescriptive vs. descriptive](https://amyrey.web.unc.edu/classes/ling-101-online/tutorials/understanding-prescriptive-vs-descriptive-grammar/) controversy for a moment, but keep in mind what I'm about to say is very close to touching that third rail. Take it with a grain of salt.

In some ways there are no inherit boundaries to reality (I don't actually believe this but it's a useful analogy). Our languages are a lot like an operating system, and they function to place boundaries on that reality so that we can understand it and communicate.

Being completely honest, there's only a very vague separation between red, orange, yellow, and so on. The boundaries we perceive are human constructs (again, very close to third rails).

This logic applies to words. There's a sense in which different languages and their corresponding cultures perceive colors differently.

Again, this logic applies to *grammatical concepts.* Prepositions in English are notoriously difficult to learn. "In, at, on, of" certainly have different, and real connotations. But, much like color, those boundaries are somewhat man-made. They're [人口.](https://jisho.org/search/man-made) If those distinctions don't exist in your first language, it's a lot like trying to see an optical illusion with brain damage, or something.

## Noer's Law of Complexity

I'm sure people *far* smarter than me have already remarked on this, but I will give you my Noer&trade; explanation of the concept.

It is a common misunderstanding among new language learners that, because a word is common, it is simple. I will provide you with an example in English.

### draconian (*adjective*): 
1. (of laws or their application) excessively harsh and severe.

### the (*determiner*):
1. denoting one or more people or things already mentioned or assumed to be common knowledge.
2. used to point forward to a following qualifying or defining clause or phrase.

"The" is one of the most common words in the English language. Provided the above definition you would have no idea what on God's green Earth I am talking about. "Draconian" isn't the *most* rare word in the English language, but I would be shocked to find an ESL speaker who knew it. The definition for "draconian" is literally 4 words long excluding the parentheses.

The truth is, the most "basic" and common words have the most abstract and difficult definitions. They're so vague and fundamental, they necessarily have to be abstract. It's the super rare and concrete adjectives and nouns that actually have the easiest to understand definitions.

## Why This Is Difficult

The reason は and が are so hard for native English speakers to understand is that

A: This grammatical distinction doesn't exist in English. At least not explicitly.
B: They're fundamental words, therefore abstract and complex.

So as a Japanese learner you are trying to wrap your mind around a color that doesn't exist, and entirely eludes definition. No wonder it's so difficult.

## The Solution

You guessed it. Immersion. Given enough exposure your brain will figure out the intuitive meaning of these words. Through usage and context it will become more clear over time. Don't bother trying to cram misleading textbook definitions. Just immerse and enjoy!
