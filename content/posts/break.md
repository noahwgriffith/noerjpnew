## Small Break

This past month I have been less active in online immersion learning circles. I've been absent from Refold, an acquaintances server, and this blog. I've had a couple major life events
happen and as a result didn't have much choice in having to put Japanese to the side. Nothing major happened though and I'm fine. I always feared having to take a break but having gone through it I think I've come away with a new perspective.

## You Won't Lost (Much) Progress

I was worried I would forget everything I had known and have to start from scratch. Hell, even forgetting half of what I knew would be devistating. Turns out that over the course of a couple weeks,
I didn't forget things. Sure, I became rusty, a couple newer words were fuzzy, I even "forgot" certain extremely rare words I had just learned, but I still recognized them as *that* word. So no,
taking some time off won't destroy your progress. Though I would be careful about taking time off on the scale of months. That would surely have some effect.

## No Gainz

I didn't gain much progress, either. Duh. Seems like it would go without saying but sometimes it's the obvious things we forget the most.

## 暗記

I was effectively taking a break from Japanese. But because of the environment I've created for myself, I still contacted the language a bit. My phone and computer are in Japanese. And
when the day was through I still wanted to watch a little anime here and there just because I found the activity intrinsically pleasant.

## It's OK To Talk To Women

lol
Seriously though, go live your life. You're probably a high schooler or in your early 20s if you have time to immerse. Talk to that girl, go on that vacation, go drink with those friends.
Japanese will still be here. Just give her meaningful attention.

So yeah. You absolutely can take a break. You'll obviously get rusty. If you went months at a time you'd start forgetting significant chunks. But that core will always be with you. And
a week or two off won't be bad at all. Just keep in mind you won't progress. So if you take every other week off don't expect to ever make it. Put the time in. But don't take it so far
you refuse to talk to women. ;)
