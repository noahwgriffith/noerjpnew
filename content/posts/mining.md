So you have your [immersion environment](/posts/what-is-immersion). You're ready to plug in and listen to gibberish all day. Great!
But how do you actually *learn anything?*

> Why is this website so vague? It seems to be all theoretical advice! Why won't you give me anything concrete?
And why are you so goddamn handsome?

Patients, my friends. All will be answered in due time.

## School Method

I remember my first day of Italian class like it was yesterday. I walked in and the teacher said *Bongiorno!* She was an intimidating lady from Sicily
(I think?) with poofy, brown hair. She started the class off by having every student introduce themselves (in English, of course). She turned out
to be one of my favorite teachers
of all time. She had a big heart (Hi Mrs. V). Later that week we were given our first vocab list. It must've contained some basic Italian such as the word for
*I* and *school.*

Eventually we would be asked to reproduce these vocabulary words. I seem to recall the test being one of those word bank match to the translation type
of deals. Most of the test was written in English, including the prompts, and the Italian that did show up was out of context. School tends to be like this.
I understand the necessity for standardized test taking, believe me. I get why the Chinese invented the civil service exam. It worked for them. But how the
bollocks are you suppoed to go from zero understanding in a language to even passable comprehension by learning the **near** English equivalent of single words,
out of context, with no sense of usage?

The problem is two-fold: Different languages are different (no sh#t), and it's hard to remember out of context information. When
we comprehend English context plays a big role. Our brains are designed to process language this way. Stealing Khatz's example, if i were to say

> A stitch in time saves...

You could answer

> Nine!

What are you, a wizard? Are you clairvoyant? No, it's just that language works this way. Nobody is *good* at English. They're just used to it. We're so
used to English we can finish each other's sentences. Rather than rote memorize lists (Boo! Boring! Difficult!) we're going to hijack the linguistic
pattern recognition already built into our brains in order to learn vocabulary rapidly and efficiently.

## Sentence Mining

People online call this method sentence mining. It still requires work but I promise you it is way more fun than sitting around memorizing lists.

Here's what you're gonna do. You know how I told you to start watching TV, youtube, podcasts, or whatever else in your target language? Well, sentence mining
just consists of picking sentences out of this immersion content to learn vocabulary from. Watch the content. Wait for a sentence you almost fully understand
with the exception of one word. Look up the definition of that word (do not translate the whole sentence). See if it makes sense. If you understand
after looking up the one word, it means you were ready to learn that sentence. Avoid sentences that contain more than one unknown element. These are too
far outside of your ability to learn *for the time being*. Don't worry, the language isn't going anywhere. You will learn everything eventually. Stick
to the easy stuff. If you do this, everything is simple. The rest of the language eventually *becomes* easier and you can go back and learn the other things.
Just keep it simple. Small sentences.

Matching *target language* subtitles help with this. They can give you an exact transcription of what was said. Don't use English subtitles though. Remember, we're avoiding English like the plague. Translations
defeat the point of learning in this way. In the **absolute beginning** it might actually serve you well to memorize the most common 100 words or so.
Even that sounds like a lot to me. The only reason to do this is to get to the point where you can actually find short sentences you can understand. I never
really learned vocabularly in isolation. I was on crack. I started sentence mining from the very beginning, learning two word sentences where one word was
*I* or *Cat* or something. Very, *very* simple sentences. Eventually this snowballs into larger sentences. Before you know it, you're learning
20 word long sentences in novels meant for adults. Just give it time and be patient, stick to the easy stuff, and eventually the hard stuff becomes easy.
At this point in my journey, I've estimated my vocabulary to be around 10,000 (total sentences + 20%). This test measured it as well above 5,000.

It's a time problem, really. The process is easy.

### A Note on i+1

When a sentence contains one phoneme outside of your ability it is considered *i+1*. Where *i* represents your current linguistic competence. Not i+2 or i+3. These are too
far outside of your understanding. It's difficult to learn more than one thing at once. Stick to i+1.

## SRS

I said I calculated my vocabulary as total sentences + 20%. The 20% is incidental learning. Even if you never bothered to look anything up you would still learn
a lot just through contextual repitition. You know this happens in English when you start using the same slang as your friends.

But wait, how did I track this? When you sentence mine you're going to use what's called an *SRS* (Spaced Repition System). This is flashcard software
that uses an algorithm to show you cards right when it thinks you will forget. This is what allows you to have a deck of nearly 10k sentences but only have
to review about 60 - 80 cards a day. I use [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). I suggest anki because it has a lot of customization (you can create the cards
using a templating language and write custom CSS for them). You don't have to touch any of the advanced features, but they're there. There's also a lot of
resources online for it if you ever get stuck. On the front of the card you want the full sentence with no additional information. On the back you want
to have the definition of the word you're targeting, the correct reading (if relevant to your language), and any additional contextual information
that helps you understand.

## Example in English

Let's say you read this sentence.

> I like blue t-shirts

You understand everything except the word "blue." After looking up this word, the sentence becomes clear. This is when you should make a flash card. You will
have the original sentence on the front. The definition goes on the back.

## Example in Japanese

Let's say you're watching a show and you have the matching subtitles.

![example](/miningexample.png)

The sentence is 星がきれいだね. You jump for joy because you almost understand the whole thing except for that pesky 星. After looking it up you learn
it means star. You look at the sentence again and fully comprehend it. "The stars are pretty." Time to make a card!

Front:
![example](/examplefront.png)

Back:
![example](/exampleback.png)

My cards are themed heavily, and I use other external tools to make creating them streamlined. At a minimum you should have the sentence, correct reading on the back, and a definition.
I also include the pitch accent, part of speech, picture, sentence audio from the show, and word audio from a database.

### A Note Monolingual Definitions

The benefit to using monolingual definitions is that some concepts make more sense explained in their native language. On top of this, learning the words for
grammar/parts of speech in Japanese helps you understand Japanese the same way a Japanese student does. This is especially true for parts of speech, as
some don't transfer cleanly into English. I suggest you switch to monolingual dictionaries ASAP!

## To Wrap Up

Don't waste your time learning vocab lists. It's boring, it's inefficent, and it sucks. Learn sentences instead. Learn sentences from the shows you watch, the
books you read, the music you listen to, and anything else. This way you can learn the *sense* in which words are used. And watching TV is way more fun than
memorizing lists.
