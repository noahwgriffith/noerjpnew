## Feature Set

When learning a language radically different from your native tongue you quickly discover new *features*. I know a lot of learners hate kanji, but it's by far my favorite part of Japanese. These little characters all have their own unique personality. They can convey a lot of meaning by themselves and the reading is not necessarily consistent. This gives the written language a degree of flexibility not granted to you in English. On top of this, authors of some light novels get creative with furigana, changing the ordinary reading. This leads to some interesting usage and, with a little creativity, written Japanese can convey things the spoken language cannot. Let alone any other language.

## The Best Sentence I've Ever Read

I've seen a lot of creative uses of kanji and furigana in my Japanese life (two and half years young, baby) but this is easily the greatest usage I've seen so far. I haven't added a sentence to my SRS this fast in my life. I hope your reading is sharp (you are reading every day, right?) because without further ado, I present to you the greatest written sentence of Japanese of all time:

この期に及んで軽い雰囲気を捨てない[政近]{まさちか}に、周囲から[勇者]{バカ}を見る目が向けられる。

## Untranslatable

No. I'm not exaggerating. Sure, I could translate the literal meaning of this sentence and you could follow along with the plot. But the humor, the craftsmanship of this sentence, with the furigana, would be gone. Gone forever. Lost in translation. The only way to properly translate this sentence to someone who doesn't already have a tenuous grasp on Japanese would be a brief lesson on CJK languages. It would likely take a paragraph to explain it.

Learn your language. Don't you want to be *in on it?*
