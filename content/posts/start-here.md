You want to learn Japanese (or another language). This website is about how to do that effectively.

This website is not a detailed explanation about why that works. (Though there will be some explanation.) For more detail about the point of this website see [about](/about).

## Who is this for?

Friends have asked me how to learn a language. Hi Kyle. Hi Jack. I wanted to put a concise explanation online so people can read it. This method is geared towards getting a high level of fluency in the language. If you want to order a meal on your next trip to Barcelona, this is overkill. If you want to read comics, make friends, and watch TV, keep reading.

## What does it mean to learn a language?

Learning a language and acquiring it are different. Learning it is what you are accustomed to doing in school. This involves rote memorization and the useage of grammar rules. Acquiring a language is what you did to learn your native language. It's the reason I am able to write this article right now without my brain exploding. Your goal is to replicate this process. You want to be able to use the language you've heard/read without thinking too hard about it.

## Why does it matter?

Because if you get stuck using textbooks and classrooms to learn, you will never reach your goal.

## How does this work?

For reasons I will not explain here ([other people](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B4%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A7%E3%83%B3) much smarter than me have taken care of that), you do this "acquiring" thing when you get input in your target language. Especially when it makes sense and is engaging. So if you watch a TV show in your target language, and enjoy it, you meet these criteria.

1. It's interesting. You like it.
2. You can sort of follow along and you get a sense for how words are used.

> I can't understand anything yet. How am I supposed to get anything out of watching a TV show?

That's why you should start by learning vocabularly. But more importantly, even if you understand exactly 0%, your brain will still be getting used to the sounds. Most languages you try to learn will have sounds that don't exist in your native language. You have to start getting used to them.

Give it a shot. After your first few episodes of TV you will find yourself saying "wait, I think I've heard that before."

Learning vocabulary will make this prcess faster.

> Okay. I trust you, stranger on the internet. How should I start?

## How to start

1. Learn vocabularly. I recommend you use an SRS like anki. Most people agree. Because you've just started, anything works. My friend Kyle uses duolingo. I hate duolingo. But it works for him. And he knows what his goals are.
2. Listen. For the reasons mentioned previously.
3. Read. You should be literate. Plus, it's a super effective way to learn more vocabulary. Especially once you've overcome the initial learning curve.
4. Repeat. Do this until you kind of understand Japanese. Or Danish. Or French. Or Cantonese. or [Xhosa](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B3%E3%82%B5%E8%AA%9E).

> When will I speak?

When you're ready.

Trust me.
